     <p>Lord Krishna is the path finder of all living beings.
       His teachings in the Gita to Arjuna are immortal.
       His every word is the ocean of knowledge and wisdom. 
       The man on this mortal world is confused and frustrated like Arjuna.
       In every juncture of his life, man is tied with the worldly shackles.
       His life is like the infinite depth of ocean and like the MAHABHARATA WAR. 
       In every walk of his life, he has to fight with the tides and foes of his own desires, egos, hungers, hatreds, angers, greeds, lust and anxieties. But, the man, who follows the knowledge and wisdom of Lord Krishna, he could swim this world of ocean and reach to the next shore; and conquer the MAHABHARATA WAR of his life. 
       His life on this corporeal earth will be filled with bliss, peace and tranquilities.</p>

        <li> Whenever dharma declines and the purpose of life is forgotten, I manifest myself on earth. I am born in every age to protect the good, to destroy evil, and to establish dharma.As they approach me, so I receive them. All paths, Arjuna, lead to me. I am the beginning, middle, and end of creation. Among animals I am the lion; among birds, the eagle Garuda. I am Prahlada, born among the demons, and of all that measures, I am time.</li>
        <li>I am death, which overcomes all, and the source of all beings still to be born.Just remember that I am, and that I support the entire cosmos with only a fragment of my being. Behold, Arjuna, a million divine forms, with an infinite variety of color and shape. Behold the gods of the natural world, and many more wonders never revealed before. Behold the entire cosmos turning within my body, and the other things you desire to see. I am time, the destroyer of all; I have come to consume the world.</li>
        <li>That one is dear to me who runs not after the pleasant or away from the painful, grieves not, last not, but lets things come and go as they happen.Just as a reservoir is of little use when the whole countryside is flooded, scriptures are of little use to the illumined man or woman, who sees the Lord everywhere.They alone see truly who see the Lord the same in every creature, who see the deathless in the hearts of all that die. Seeing the same Lord everywhere, they do not harm themselves or others. Thus they attain the supreme goal.</li>
